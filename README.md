# Heroku API blog prototype

A prototype from way back when engineers at Heroku wanted to blog, but there wasn't really an engineering blog to post to, so I made this to try and convince people that it was doable, but didn't have the muscle to push anything through in an organizational sense. We finally made a new blog years later which was never used much beyond marketing.

Rescued from a Heroku deployment after Heroku-pocalypse, now deployed [on GitHub](https://brandur.github.io/heroku-api-blog).

Original Ruby app is in [`ruby/`](./ruby), which doesn't run anymore because of outdated Ruby dependencies and an ill-advised JavaScript build pipeline, so it's been stored as a static site with minor edits to [`static/`](./static).
